READ ME File Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Context for the data:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity
at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 


For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment

The final data shows:
=======================================
-Mean summary for each Mean, meanFrequency and standard deviation with detail of Accelerometer,AccelerometerJerk, AccelerometerMagnitude, AcelerometerJerkMagnitude, Gyroscope, GyroscopeJerk,GyroscopeMagnitude, GyroscopeJerkMagnitude. 

-Activity includes 6 types: [Laying Stiting Standing Walking walking downstairs and Walking upstairs]

-For each 30 subjects. 

In total the final dataset is composed of 180 Observations and 88 variables.
